# landing-page

project is about creating a landing page
By the end of the project i will have been able to show basic skills in my html and css flexbox especially.

# Made the header section flexboxes move around using actual figures like 20px.

I wasnt able to figure out how to put align them correctly

# Gave the .text class its width according to it image size

I was giving the .sub-images class the width of a a single image causing the .sub-images which is the container of the images and the text of  .body-one, which caused the justify content not to work.

# made another container in .body-two called .try

so that the quote will can be centered in the .body-two container and it can be given a width that will not affect the .body-two container.

# removed a container around the contents of .body-two and i also removed  the width

so that the .quote will shrink even without the flex-wrap property.
